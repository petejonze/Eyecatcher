# Eyecatcher
Source code for "Eyecatcher": An open-source visual field test using remote eye-tracking

# Please note
Thank you for visiting this repository. Unfortunately, the MATLAB code for Eyecatcher proved too complicated for most people to use, and our attempt to share the code was becoming counterproductive (particularly since the hardware that Eyecatcher was originally designed to use is no longer commercially available). We therefore took the decision to discontinue this codebase, and sicne 2020 have been working on a new, simplified Eyecatcher "app", which we hope to make available as soon as it can be fully validated.

Kind Regards, Dr Pete Jones
